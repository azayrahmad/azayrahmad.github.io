Hey there! I'm Aziz Rahmad, a software engineer with a knack for creating innovative enterprise software solutions. With over seven years in the industry, I've had the pleasure of developing and supporting complex systems for clients across Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.

By day, I'm deep in code, working on everything from bug fixes to building data-driven solutions. By night, I swap my developer hat for a teacherâ€™s cap, sharing my passion for technology with college students. As a part-time lecturer, nothing makes me happier than seeing a student's "aha" moment when a tricky concept finally clicks.

I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to upskill. Whether it's mastering the latest programming language or diving into the newest tech trend, I love expanding my horizons and keeping my skills sharp.

But wait, there's more! I'm also a proud father to a wonderful daughter, and I strive to balance my professional life with family time. From coding marathons to bedtime stories, I enjoy every bit of it.

So, welcome to my little corner of the web. Feel free to explore my projects, check out my experience, and get to know a bit more about what makes me tick. If you're looking for someone who loves both teaching and tech, you've come to the right place!
